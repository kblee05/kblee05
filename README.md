### Hi there, I'm Kenneth Lee 👋

I am an undergraduate student at **Seoul National University**, currently majoring in **Architecture** and focusing on **Computer Science and Engineering**.

My primary research interests lie in **Computer Systems**, **Operating Systems**, and **System Architecture**. I am passionate about understanding how software interacts with hardware and building efficient, low-level systems.

I am actively looking for **Research Intern** opportunities where I can contribute to ongoing system research projects.

### 📌 Pinned Projects & Experience

#### [Nand2Tetris](https://github.com/kblee05/Nand2Tetris)
> **Building a Modern Computer from First Principles**
> - Constructed a complete general-purpose computer system starting from NAND gates to the Operating System.
> - **Implemented the full compilation toolchain using C++**, establishing a seamless translation pipeline:
>   `Jack Compiler` $\to$ `VM Translator` $\to$ `Assembler` $\to$ `Binary Machine Code`.
> - Developed the Standard Library (OS) including memory management (`alloc`, `deAlloc`), math routines, and I/O drivers.
> - Gained deep understanding of the hardware-software interface and abstraction layers.

#### [Memory-Allocator](https://github.com/kblee05/Memory-Allocator)
> **Custom Dynamic Memory Allocator Implementation**
> - Designed and implemented a dynamic memory allocator (`malloc`, `free`, `realloc`) in C.
> - Utilized **explicit free list** and **segregated free list** to optimize memory throughput and utilization.
> - Analyzed performance trade-offs between fragmentation and allocation speed.
